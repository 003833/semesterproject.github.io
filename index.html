<h1>Neil Armstrong</h1>
<p>Neil A. Armstrong served as a naval aviator from 1949 to 1952 before joining the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory in 1955. Later that year, he transferred to the NACAâ€™s High-Speed Flight Station in Edwards, California, as an aeronautical research scientist and then as a pilot, a position he held until becoming an astronaut in 1962. He was one of nine NASA astronauts in the second class to be chosen.</p>
